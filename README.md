# Building a Spam Filter with Naive Bayes
 
Most people, including myself, take for granted the usefulness of the spam filter on their email inboxes. It saves us alot of time and hassel sorting through junk, and protects us from harmful content.

The objective of this project is to develop a similar filter for the SMS messages received on our mobile devices. To do that we'll "teach" the computer to classify messages as spam or not spam using the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm along with a dataset of 5572 SMS messages that are already classified by humans.

The dataset was put together by Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo, and it can be downloaded from the The [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection).

This project was completed as part of the Conditional Probability course offered by [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/course/conditional%20probability/).
